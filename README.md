## Core Java: A Branching Roadmap 
[![](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=java)](https://skillicons.dev)

**Progress:** 🟩🟩🟩⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜

**1. Fundamentals**✅
- Data Types:
    * ✔️Primitive types (numeric, boolean, char)
    * ✔️Non-primitive types (String, arrays, objects)
    * ✔️Type casting and conversions
- Variables & Operators:
    * ✔️Declaring and initializing variables
    * ✔️Arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators
- Control Flow:
    * ✔️`if`, `else`, `switch` statements for conditional branching
    * ✔️`for`, `while`, `do-while` loops for iteration
- Methods:
    * ✔️Creating and invoking methods
    * ✔️Parameters, return values, method overloading
- Wrapper Class:
    * ✔️UnderStanding the Difference between Primitive and Reference Types
    * ✔️Access the Methods to each Wrappers
- Introduction to OOP:
    * ✔️Basic OOP concepts (objects, classes, inheritance, polymorphism)

**2. Arrays**✅
- Declaring and Creating:
    * ✔️Defining arrays with data types and sizes
    * ✔️Initializing elements using literal values or loops
- Accessing Elements:
    * ✔️Using indices to access and modify elements within bounds
- Multidimensional Arrays:
    * ✔️Creating arrays with more than one dimension
    * ✔️Nested access using multiple indices

**3. Strings**✅
- String Class:
    * ✔️ Essential methods for manipulation (e.g., `length()`, `charAt()`, `substring()`, `concat()`, `indexOf()`)
    * ✔️String immutability: Understanding that Strings are unchangeable; creating new instances for modifications

**4. Package Management**❌
- Packages:
    * Organizing classes into logical groups
    * Accessing classes using import statements
- Access Modifiers:
    * public, private, protected, and default access control

**5. Object-Oriented Programming**❌

- Classes & Objects:
    * Class definition and members (variables, methods)
    * Object creation and instantiation
    * Member access using the `.` operator
- Abstraction:
    * Interfaces: Separating interface from implementation
    * Abstract classes: Providing partial implementation and enforcing specific methods in subclasses
- Encapsulation:
    * Data hiding and access control with public, private, protected modifiers
- Inheritance:
    * Single inheritance: Extending parent classes, method overriding using `super` keyword
- Polymorphism:
    * Method overloading: Having methods with the same name but different parameters
    * Method overriding: Redefining inherited methods in child classes
    * Abstract classes and interfaces: Defining contracts for subclasses to implement

**6. Exception Handling**❌
- Try-catch-finally:
    * Handling runtime errors gracefully
    * Catching specific exceptions with `catch` blocks
    * Ensuring resources are released with `finally` blocks
- Throwing and Catching Exceptions:
    * Throwing exceptions using `throw` keyword
    * Catching exceptions with appropriate handlers
- Common Exceptions:
    * Understanding common exceptions like `NullPointerException`, `IndexOutOfBoundsException`, etc.

**7. I/O Operations**❌
- File I/O:
    * Reading and writing data from files using streams
    * Classes like `FileInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`
- Standard I/O:
    * ✔System.in for user input
    * ✔System.out for printing output
    * ✔Using the `Scanner` class for simplified input with various data types

**8. Collections**❌

- Understanding Concepts:
    * ✔️Lists, Sets, Maps, and their common implementations (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`)
- Adding, Removing, Accessing Elements:
    * Using appropriate methods for each collection type
- Choosing the Right Collection:
    * Selecting the most suitable collection based on requirements like order, duplicate elements, thread safety

**9. Multithreading**❌

- Thread Basics:
    * Creating and managing threads for concurrent execution
    * Understanding thread states (running, waiting, etc.)
- Synchronization:
    * Preventing race conditions and data corruption when multiple threads access shared resources
    * `synchronized` keyword, locks, wait-notify mechanisms
- Concurrency Concepts:
    * Thread pools for efficient management
    * `Fork/Join` framework for parallel processing
    * `CompletableFuture` for asynchronous programming

**🔭GUI Development:**
* ❤️JavaFX
* Swing



**🔭Web Development:**
* ❤️Spring MVC
* Servlets
* JSP

**🔭Networking:**
* Sockets, TCP/IP, HTTP communication
* Java libraries for network programming
